# What I knew, thought I knew, and now know

## What I knew

Programming:

* python
  * string manipulation
  * for loops
  * while loops
  * if statements (including elif)
  * def
  * classes
    * Static methods: don't access anything within the class
    * Class methods: can access attributes within the object
  * Creating images using python (did it very briefly)
  

* Java
  * String manipulation
  * for loops, while loops, if statements
  * creating functions
  * how to use typing with java
  * creating methods and classes
  * vectors, linked lists, queues, stacks, quicksort, mergesort,
    heaps, heapsort, 
  

* Data Analysis (python)
  * I had used pandas, scipystats, matplotlib, and numpy to create dataframes, read in data, and create models of certain data with code (STATS2120 class). 
  * Regression, multiple regression, bar charts, median, mean, mode, etc. 
  * Cleaning data so that I could use the parts I needed. 

Software Development:
* I have made classes and objects before and then called them in other classes (like a node in a linked-list), but I am not skilled in it yet (although I have improved since the start of the REU). I have not put together significant amounts of code for projects, but that is a goal of mine, because I like doing it and wish I knew more about how to make things flow together. 
* Not skilled in object oriented programming- something I would love to become better at. 
* Curious about how to connect backend programming (what I typically do) to frontend results (sort of like fastAPI). 

Command Line Interface Things:
* I knew how to cd and ls and activate the terminal, but that was about it. 
* I knew how to run a python script from the command line
* I did not know how to create commands. 
* I did not know about shells or scripting (still don't, really) 
* I did not know that there were different commands across OSs
* I knew about memory and the difference between that and hardrive. 
* I did not know how to use the command line, really.
* I did not know how to install packages or really the general command line "language" structure (like <program> <command> --arguments, --options --flags)

Cloud Computing:
* Knew nothing. 

Artificial Intelligence:

* Knew nothing. 

Machine Learning:

* Only knew some key concepts like training and modeling. 

## What I thought I knew

Programming:

* classes and object oriented programming
* command line (somewhat)
* data manipulation and modeling
* software development basics
* how to use packages (installation, importing, utilization)
* basically, I didn't realize how much of a beginner I am. 

## What I know now

Progamming:

* I am slightly better at object oriented programming
* I am better at understanding what code is doing (code review things)
* I am better at utilizing code that has already been created
* I am better at creating better code (meaning that the code looks better, produces better output rather than being very basic)
* I now know about python testing
* I now know class programming (and how difficult it is for me)
* I now kow about how undergraduate teachers teach theory, but in reality, others want real results (i.e., you would spend 10+ hours coding heapsort when you could use the python implementation that has already been optimized). 
* I better understand the way computers work. 

Software Development:

* having started to work on the REST service, here is what I have learned:
  * Most of the time, I have the skills to code up 90-95% of the        project, but that last 5-10% kills 95% of my time and energy on a   project. 
  * I get stuck when there are many methods that all call on            themselves. But I am now better about working through these         challenges. 
  * I enjoy software development. 
  * I have ideas about what I could theoretically could do for          software projects. 
  * I need to submerge myself in coding to get to where I want to be. 
  * Friend told me recently that many people in CS have this initial    block like what I am having. Then, after time, they get             infinitely better and then have ideas of their own that they        create. 

Command Line Interfacing:

* I can operate my command line now. 
  * cd, ls, cat, man, help, etc etc etc
* I almost understand how to use the cloudmesh command generate to create commands.
